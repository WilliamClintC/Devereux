## Introduction

This document represents William's current work on identifying related literature. More literature will follow soon.

We have also sent a Zotero library invitation to Michael.Devereux\@ubc.ca (invited on 2025-07-10 16:56:43), which provides access to the current literature we are reviewing.

Any feedback is appreciated.

## Introduction 
This document represents William's current work on identifying related literature. More literature will follow soon. 

We have also sent a Zotero library invitation to Michael.Devereux@ubc.ca (invited on 2025-07-10 16:56:43), which provides access to the current literature we are reviewing. 

Any feedback is appreciated.

## High Relevance

### The Determinants of Real Exchange Rates in Transition Economies

**Authors:** Dan Meshulam, Peter Sanfey (EBRD)  
**Date:** 2019  
**Link:** [Read Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MldCJB2yPD3AEI93kt9qSX11rjcTdySo/view?usp=sharing)

**Note:** This paper provides empirical evidence on the drivers of real exchange rates in transition economies, including support for the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis.

## High Relevance

### The Story of the Real Exchange Rate

**Author:** Oleg Itskhoki  
**Date:** 2021  
**Link:** [Read Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vhVbum9po2xoiaPT8suUqOqjDg5o8EkI/view?usp=sharing)

**Note:** This review presents a comprehensive framework for understanding the real exchange rate (RER) as a general equilibrium outcome, emphasizing its dependence on home bias, incomplete pass-through, international risk sharing, and monetary policy regimes. It highlights the limitations of partial theories such as PPP and underscores the RER's complex empirical behavior.

## Medium to High Relevance

### The Balassa-Samuelson Effect Reversed: New Evidence from OECD Countries

**Authors:** Matthias Gubler, Christoph Sax  
**Date:** 2019  
**Link:** [Read Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17D8FzoOwr9Z-TulNWzoSWobEIz4HaWuQ/view?usp=sharing)

**Note:** This paper re-evaluates the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis using OECD panel data from 1970–2008. It finds a robust negative relationship between productivity in the tradable sector and the real exchange rate post-1985, challenging the traditional Balassa-Samuelson view.

## Medium Relevance

### Competitiveness and Productivity in the Baltics: Common Shocks, Different Implications

**Authors:** Saioa Armendariz, Carlos de Resende, Alice Fan, Gianluigi Ferrucci, Bingjie Hu, Sadhna Naik, Can Ugur  
**Date:** January 17, 2025  
**Link:** [Read Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GFUm5ckExKBUJ7CXxZ4ZyplTKT2Krc28/view?usp=sharing)

**Note:** Although the paper addresses a different research question, it provides relevance with its use of the Balassa-Samuelson framework.

## Relevant Quote
"productivity. Multivariate filtering techniques and estimates of the real effective exchange rates based on historical productivity trends, consistent with Balassa-Samuelson, confirm that differences in long-term total, factor productivity growth have affected external competitiveness."

## Low to Medium Relevance

### Exchange Rate Models Are Better Than You Think, and Why They Didn't Work in the Old Days

**Authors:** Charles Engel, Steve Pak Yeung Wu  
**Date:** 2024  
**Link:** <https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w32808/w32808.pdf>

**Note:** Exchange rate model in the context of US dollar and monetary policy.

### The Purchasing Power Parity and Exchange-Rate Economics Half a Century On

**Authors:** Hai Long Vo, Duc Hong Vo  
**Date:** 2023  
**Link:** [Read Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GvSoUtKJiy58EFfif0aoFeuvEYS26tqs/view?usp=sharing)

**Note:** A survey-style review of exchange rate economics, useful for context but limited in direct empirical relevance.

## Lowest Relevance

### Subnational Purchasing Power of Parity in OECD Countries: Estimates Based on the Balassa-Samuelson Hypothesis

**Authors:** Alex Costa, Jaume Garcia, Josep Lluís Raymond, Daniel Sánchez-Serra  
**Date:** 2019  
**Link:** [Read Paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QT0iR2TwIY5ayraL7pAe0Ir_R03U17nR/view?usp=sharing)

**Note:** Estimates regional PPPs in OECD countries using the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis. Methodologically relevant, though not directly focused on real exchange rates.
